============================================
Hacking
- Determine identity
    - IP Address, Stack, System, Location, Owner, Contents, Expected consequences
    - Port scans (manual then automated)
    - Digital fingerprint (logs, public sites, honeypots, baits)
    - Follow trails (compromised servers, routes, packet sniffing, header intrusion etc)
- Determine vulnerability
    - Version based exploits
    - Any technique
- Execute
    - Create scripts (Drag n Drop)
    - Compile
    - Use a medium
    - Run or Deliver
===============================================
Bounty
- Damage caused + cost of attacks defended * notoriety
=============================================
Loot from hacking
- IP address, exploits, code blocks, source code, scripts, softare, money,
- _Everything_ stored on the boxes
==============================================
Coding
- Need script parts or source code
- Source code
    - Minting plates for program
    - Consists of few unique and many generic code block
- Scripts
    - Pre written stuff that can be used instantly
    - Compiled from source code
- Code block
    - Language specific
    - Used to make source code
    - Differs on function
        - Loops - for, while, do while
        - Methods
        - Libs
- Compilation
    - Depends on resources and programming language
    - Adds bugs and vulnerabilities
    - Adds time factor to making scripts
