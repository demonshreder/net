Game over
- Caught by the govt.
- Ran out of money
=============================================
Hacking approaches
- Hardware & Physical
    - Bruteforce, DDoS
    - FGPA, Parallel computing
    - Cold boot attack, RF Scanning, EM attack
    - Stealing crypto keys, IDs, breaking in
- Software
    - Vulnerabilities
- Social
    - Gaining 'leverage'
    - 'Working' a contact
    - Acquiring keys
    - Fake identities
=============================================
Ways to earn money
- Job
- Hack
    - Banks
    - Accounts
    - Stock Market
    - Hijack Transactions
- Sell computer parts, loot, etc
- Services
    - Cryptocurrency mining
    - Profit from cloud services
===========================================
Software availability
- Store
- OSS
- Markets
- Code hosting sites
- Salvaged from hacked boxes
============================================
Hacking #1 - Reconnaissance
# Concerned with acquiring all relevant information
# on the target including location, identity,
# details, access points, attack approaches
- Determine identity
    - IP Address, Stack, System, Location, Owner, Contents, Expected consequences
    - Port scans, running services, 
    - Digital fingerprint (logs, public sites, honeypots, baits)
    - Follow trails (compromised servers, routes, packet sniffing, header intrusion etc)
- Determine vulnerability
    - Version based exploits
    - Any technique
- Identify attack approaches
    - Physical
        - IDs required, contacts to 'work'
        - Security routines, weak spots
        - Point of entry, blueprints
    - Remote
        - Open ports
        - Investigate integrity of downloads
        - Known vulnerabilities for target
        - Identify  
    - Via a medium
        - Infecting a thumbdrive, software
        - Coerced contacts 
===========================================
Hacking #2 - Infiltration
# Using the acquired information to gain acccess
# to the target system.
- Physical
    - Breaking in
    - SE - Appointments, fake IDs
- Internet
    - Security exploits, remote vulnerabilities
    - Phishing, cookie tracing, 'poisoning' the software
    - Existing backdoors 
===========================================
Hacking #3 - The hack itself
# Completing the purpose of the hacking and 
# gaining loot from it
- Damage
    - Rootkit
    - Crash
    - Delete
    - Infect
- Resources
    - Siphon funds
    - Use hardware over time
    - Sell access on blackmarket
    - Use as a blackbox for attacks
- Information
    - Search and steal 
    - Dump data
    - Delete logs
- Social
    - Favours
    - Faking information
    - Gain leverage
===============================================
Bounty
- Damage caused + cost of attacks defended * notoriety
=============================================
Loot from hacking
- IP address, exploits, code blocks, source code, scripts, softare, money,
- _Everything_ stored on the boxes
==============================================
Coding
- Need script parts or source code
- Source code
    - Minting plates for program
    - Consists of few unique and many generic code block
- Scripts
    - Pre written stuff that can be used instantly
    - Compiled from source code
    - Contain types of bugs
- Code block
    - Language specific
    - Used to make source code
    - Differs on function
        - Loops - for, while, do while
        - Methods
        - Libs
- Compilation
    - Depends on resources and programming language
    - Adds bugs and vulnerabilities
    - Adds time factor to making scripts

================================================
Computer
- Hardware
    - RAM
    - CPU
    - HDD
    - GPU
    - NIC
    - MB 
- Software
    - OS 
    - Other softwares

================================================
Factions
- Influence
    - Gives perks
    - Opens new quests
    - Contacts
- Special access
    - Software, Hardware, resources
