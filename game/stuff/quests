The screen zooms onto a working computer screen. There
is a notification for a new mail. You click on it.
"You are to see me at my office immediately.<name>"
Oh oh. This means trouble, should get there quick.

    - Talk to your boss

*Knocks* 
*Boss looks up from viewing a file* "Get in"
"You wanted to see me?" *while walking in*
